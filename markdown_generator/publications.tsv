TBD	Reinforcement Learning-Based Optimization of Relay Selection and Transmission Scheduling for UAV-Aided mmWave Vehicular Networks	27th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications, 2024	 Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications offer abundant bandwidth for vehicular networks; however, they
 are prone to blockages due to buildings, topology, and other environmental factors. To address these challenges, we
 propose a novel unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided two-way relaying system to enhance vehicular connectivity and
 coverage. We formulate a joint optimization problem for relay selection and transmission scheduling to minimize
 transmission time while ensuring throughput requirements. Proximal policy optimization, deep Q-network, and
 constraint programming models are employed to solve the optimization problem. Extensive evaluations reveal that the
 proximal policy optimization model achieves close to 100% accuracy.	Your Name, You. (2009). "Paper Title Number 1." <i>Journal 1</i>. 1(1).	paper-title-number-1	http://academicpages.github.io/files/paper1.pdf	http://academicpages.github.io/files/slides1.pdf
