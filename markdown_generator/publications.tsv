TBD	Reinforcement Learning-Based Optimization of Relay Selection and Transmission Scheduling for UAV-Aided mmWave Vehicular Networks	27th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications	Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications offer abundant bandwidth for vehicular networks; however, they are prone to blockages due to buildings, topology, and other environmental factors. To address these challenges, we propose a novel unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided two-way relaying system to enhance vehicular connectivity and coverage. We formulate a joint optimization problem for relay selection and transmission scheduling to minimize transmission time while ensuring throughput requirements. Proximal policy optimization, deep Q-network, and constraint programming models are employed to solve the optimization problem. Extensive evaluations reveal that the proximal policy optimization model achieves close to 100% accuracy.	Aditya Guhagarkar, You. (2024).
