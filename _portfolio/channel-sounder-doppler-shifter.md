**Supervisor**: Prof. David Michelson, University of British Columbia  
**Duration**: May 2023 - Aug 2023

Built a Channel Sounder and Doppler Shifter using ADALM PLUTO SDRs, with applications in satellite communication:
- Designed a Doppler Shifter to generate frequency shifts and correct Doppler distortions.
- Conducted wireless channel analysis with LTE modulation in MATLAB, reducing bit error rates.
