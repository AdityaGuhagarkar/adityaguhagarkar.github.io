**Supervisor**: Prof. Dr. Vimal Bhatia  
**Duration**: May 2022 - Dec 2023

Developed a narrowband radar system using the Ettus USRP B210 SDR. This project involved:
- Operating SDR to measure object distances and adjusting the carrier frequency to study penetration depth.
- Designing an MFCW radar algorithm integrated with GNU Radio.
- Using the Texas Instruments TI AWR1642 for additional measurements, accurately identifying subsurface metallic plates.
