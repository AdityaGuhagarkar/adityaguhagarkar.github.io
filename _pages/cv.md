Experience
======
* **Research Intern**, University of Michigan  
  *Aug. 2025 – Present*  
  -  Built a streaming RL framework in Jelly Bean World to evaluate continuous decision-making, demonstrating improved stability and performance over multiple DQN variants.
  -  Implemented a contrastive RL approach that augments RRT-based planning, enabling robust trajectory generation for high-DOF robots.
  -  Supervisor: Prof. Lei Ying
    
* **Research Intern**, 6G Flagship, University of Oulu (Remote)  
  *Apr. 2025 – Present*  
  -  Designed a Graph Attention Network (GAT) for downlink power allocation in multi-cell Massive MIMO systems under spatially correlated Rician fading, targeting maximization of sum-rate while mitigating intra-cell interference.
  -  Benchmarked the model against the WMMSE baseline across supervised, unsupervised, and hybrid training paradigms.
  -  Supervisor: Dr. Thushan Sivalingam & Prof. Nandana Rajatheva
