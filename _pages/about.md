      <b>University of British Columbia (UBC)</b><br>
      Research Intern ‚Äì Summer 2023<br>
      Designed a channel sounder and Doppler shifter using ADALM-PLUTO SDRs to measure channel impulse response, path loss, and Doppler shifts, with applications in satellite and wireless communications. Executed LTE-based signal processing and real-time Doppler correction in MATLAB, achieving near 100% BER reduction under test conditions through dynamic feedback-based distortion mitigation.

      <b>6G Flagship | University of Oulu, Finland</b><br>
      Research Intern ‚Äì Summer 2025<br>
      Developed a Graph Neural Network-based framework for power allocation in multi-cell MIMO systems for 6G networks. Implemented a Graph Convolutional Network model and benchmarked its performance against the WMMSE algorithm using both supervised and unsupervised learning approaches. Evaluated results based on output data rate distributions.
