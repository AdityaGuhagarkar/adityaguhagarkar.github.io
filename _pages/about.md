# About Me

I am a Master’s student in **Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)** at the **University of Michigan**, with a strong passion for **wireless communications**, **5G/6G physical layer (L1)**, **AI-native Radio Access Networks (AI-RAN)**, and **vehicular networks**. I’m driven by the goal of designing communication systems that are fast, reliable, and intelligent—paving the way for the future of **smart cities** and connected mobility.

## 🎓 Academic & Research Interests
My academic journey lies at the intersection of signal processing, optimization, and machine learning for next-generation wireless systems. My key interests include:
- **5G/6G Physical Layer (L1)** – Developing PHY layer technologies such as link adaptation, beamforming, MIMO, and signal processing for high-capacity, low-latency networks.
- **AI-Native RAN (AI-RAN)** – Applying machine learning to optimize and automate radio access networks for enhanced performance and adaptability.
- **Vehicular Networks** – Enabling connected and autonomous mobility with ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) and robust network design.
- **Smart Cities** – Building intelligent infrastructure that integrates vehicles, devices, and people for sustainable, connected urban ecosystems.

I completed my undergraduate degree in **Electrical Engineering from IIT Indore**, where I was actively involved in research, published at international conferences, and collaborated with leading academic groups.

## ♟️ Chess – A Strategic Foundation
I’ve been a competitive chess player since childhood, with a **FIDE rating of 2046** at the international level. Chess has deeply influenced my problem-solving approach—teaching me to think strategically, adapt quickly, and approach challenges with foresight and precision.

## 🏞️ Trekking – A Pursuit of Resilience
When not solving engineering problems, you’ll often find me in the mountains. I’ve completed multiple high-altitude treks in the **Himalayas**, where the mental endurance and adaptability required reflect the same mindset I bring to research and problem-solving.

## ⚽ Sports & Balance
I strongly believe in maintaining balance beyond academics. Whether on the field or the trail, sports and physical activity have been a constant source of discipline, focus, and energy throughout my journey.
