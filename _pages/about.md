# About Me

I am a Master’s student at the **University of Michigan**, Department of **Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)**, specializing in **wireless communications**, **5G/6G physical layer**, **AI-native RAN**, and **vehicular networks**. I aspire to develop intelligent and reliable communication systems for **smart cities** and **connected mobility**.

Before Michigan, I completed my undergraduate studies at the **Indian Institute of Technology Indore**, majoring in **Electrical Engineering**, where I engaged in research on wireless systems and published at international conferences. I was awarded the **Institute Gold Medal for Best All-Rounder** for my work during my bachelor's.

  <img src="/images/umich.jpeg" style="width: 60px; margin-right: 15px;">
  <div>
    <strong>University of Michigan</strong><br>
    <em>Research Assistant, under Prof. Lei Ying</em><br>
    Built a streaming RL framework in Jelly Bean World to evaluate continuous decision-making, demonstrating improved stability and performance over multiple DQN variants. Implemented a contrastive RL approach that augments RRT-based planning, enabling robust trajectory generation for high-DOF robots.

  <div>
    <strong>6G Flagship | University of Oulu, Finland</strong><br>
    <em>Research Intern, under Prof. Nandana Rajatheva</em><br>
    Designed a Graph Attention Network (GAT) for downlink power allocation in multi-cell Massive MIMO systems under spatially correlated Rician fading, targeting maximization of sum-rate while mitigating intra-cell interference. Benchmarked the model against the WMMSE baseline across supervised, unsupervised, and hybrid training paradigms.

  <div>
    <strong>University of British Columbia (UBC)</strong><br>
    <em>Research Intern, under Prof. David Michelson – Summer 2023</em><br>
    Designed a channel sounder and Doppler shifter using ADALM-PLUTO SDRs to measure channel impulse response, path loss, and Doppler shifts for satellite and wireless communication. Executed LTE-based signal processing and real-time Doppler correction in MATLAB, achieving near 100% BER reduction through dynamic feedback-based distortion mitigation.
