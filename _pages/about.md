# About Me

I am a Master‚Äôs student at the **University of Michigan**, Department of **Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)**, specializing in **wireless communications**, **5G/6G physical layer**, **AI-native RAN**, and **vehicular networks**. I aspire to develop intelligent and reliable communication systems for **smart cities** and **connected mobility**.

Before Michigan, I completed my undergraduate studies at the **Indian Institute of Technology Indore**, majoring in **Electrical Engineering**, where I engaged in research on wireless systems and published at international conferences.

  <img src="/images/ubcvan.jpeg" style="width: 60px; margin-right: 15px;">
  <div>
    <strong>University of British Columbia (UBC)</strong><br>
    <em>Research Intern ‚Äì Summer 2023</em><br>
    Designed a channel sounder and Doppler shifter using ADALM-PLUTO SDRs to measure channel impulse response, path loss, and Doppler shifts for satellite and wireless communication. Executed LTE-based signal processing and real-time Doppler correction in MATLAB, achieving near 100% BER reduction through dynamic feedback-based distortion mitigation.

    <strong>6G Flagship | University of Oulu, Finland</strong><br>
    <em>Research Intern ‚Äì Summer 2025</em><br>
    Developed a Graph Neural Network-based framework for power allocation in multi-cell MIMO systems for 6G networks. Implemented a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model and benchmarked its performance against the WMMSE algorithm using both supervised and unsupervised learning approaches. Evaluated models based on output data rate distributions.
