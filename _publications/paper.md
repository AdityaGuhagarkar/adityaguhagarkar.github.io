title: "Reinforcement Learning-Based Optimization of Relay Selection and Transmission Scheduling for UAV-Aided mmWave Vehicular Networks"
collection: publications
category: conferences
excerpt: 'Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications offer abundant bandwidth for vehicular networks; however, they
 are prone to blockages due to buildings, topology, and other environmental factors. To address these challenges, we
 propose a novel unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided two-way relaying system to enhance vehicular connectivity and
 coverage. We formulate a joint optimization problem for relay selection and transmission scheduling to minimize
 transmission time while ensuring throughput requirements. Proximal policy optimization, deep Q-network, and
 constraint programming models are employed to solve the optimization problem. Extensive evaluations reveal that the
 proximal policy optimization model achieves close to 100% accuracy.'
