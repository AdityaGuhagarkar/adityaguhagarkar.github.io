title: "Comparative Analysis of Scheduling Strategies for RIS-Empowered Wireless Networks with Non-Linear Energy Harvesting"
collection: publications
category: conferences
excerpt: >
  This paper investigates scheduling schemes for RIS-assisted wireless systems with non-linear energy harvesting,
  comparing TDMA, random selection, constraint programming (CP), and deep Q-network (DQN) approaches.
  While CP provides optimal performance at the cost of computational complexity, DQN achieves approximately
  90% of CPâ€™s throughput while reducing decision latency by over 1000 times, making it highly suitable for real-time
  RIS-assisted networks. The work highlights trade-offs between throughput, computational time, and adaptability.
