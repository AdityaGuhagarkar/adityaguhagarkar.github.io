excerpt: >
  This paper presents a comparative study of scheduling mechanisms in RIS-assisted wireless networks with non-linear energy harvesting constraints. Four techniques are evaluated: Deep Q-Network (DQN), Constraint Programming (CP), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), and random user selection. TDMA and random selection offer simplicity but underperform in dense networks. While CP guarantees optimal decisions, its high computational complexity makes it unsuitable for real-time deployment. The DQN-based approach strikes an effective balance, achieving ~90% of CPâ€™s throughput while reducing decision latency by over 1000x. This highlights DQN as a highly viable solution for real-time scheduling in RIS-enabled networks.
